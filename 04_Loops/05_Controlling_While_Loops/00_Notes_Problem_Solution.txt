Problem:
Let's use while loop and a 'counter' variable to display the rankings
for the top three Olympians in the console.


Task:
Inside the while loop,
we'll increase the 'place' variable and display it's value.


Solution:
1.  Start by displaying the title for the rankings in the console.
2.  We need a counter variable to keep track of each Olympian's place.
    Create a variable named 'place' and assign it 1.
3.  Now code the while loops that loops through the rankings.
4.  Since, we want to show the top three Olympians,
    make sure the loop only repeats while place is less than 4.
5.  Now display 'place' in the console to start showing the rankings.
6.  To stop the infinite loop, increment the 'place' variable with '++'.
7.  Let's jazz up the leader board a bit by displaying a period after each number.

Problem:
WAP to print counts by twos using the while loop.


Solution:
1.  Create a counter variable named 'number' and assign 0 to it.
2.  Code the condition so that the loop repeats its code 
    while number is less than 20.
3.  Inside the code block, display the 'number' variable in console.
4.  Use the '+=' operator to increase the 'number' variable by two.
5.  Since the number variable increases before we display it,
    2 displays in the console first and not 0. Shift the display stmt before
6.  Try changing the number by 3, 4 etc.

Problem:
A developer tried displaying an asterisk '*' and tildes '~'
to simulate a beach. The '*' for the sun and the '~' for the waves.


Task:
Unfortunately, they made a few mistakes using a 'while' loop
to display the waves, so we'll help them out.
JS Code ->
var line = "";

console.log("*");

while (counter > 5) {
    line -= "~";
    counter++;
}


Solution:
1.  Start by creating the counter variable 
    used in the while loop and assign it 1.
2.  The developer wanted to stop the loop when counter is greater than 5.
    Let's fix that by updating the condition to counter <= 5.
3.  Inside the while loop's code block, update the '-=' operator
    so that it adds the string to line.
4.  Display the 'line' variable each time
    the 'while' loop runs it code block.
5.  Change the number to display more waves i.e. 10 rows of waves.
6.  Display something other than '*' and '~'.
