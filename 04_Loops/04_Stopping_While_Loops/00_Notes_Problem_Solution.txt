Problem:
In airplanes, pilots turn on the "Fasten Seatbeat" sign
when the plane encounters turbulence on a flight.


Task:
Write a Program that displays "Fasten Seatbelt" 
while the 'turbulence' variable equals true.


Solution:
1.  Start by creating a 'turbulence' variable and assigning it 'true'.
2.  Code the while loop.
3.  To repeat the loop while 'turbulence' equals 'true',
    Check if 'turbulence' equals 'true'.
4.  Display "Fasten Seatbelt" while 'turbulence' equals 'true'.
5.  Stop the while loop after it runs the code once
    by setting 'turbulence' to 'false' inside the code block.

Problem:
Let's build a program that displays a triangle in the console.


Task:
We'll code a while loop that adds an asterisk to the 'line' variable
and displays the line of asterisks each time the code block runs.


Solution:
1.  Start by creating a variable named 'line'
    set to "" and a variable named 'shouldLoop' set to 'true'.
2.  Code the while loop having condition where 'shouldLoop' equals 'true'.
3.  To add an asterisk to line each time the loop repeat its code block,
    add "* " to the end of the line variable.
4.  To see a triangle of asterisks in the console,
    display the 'line' variable inside the while loop's code block.
5.  Now that we've had our fun, update 'shouldLoop' to 'false'
    inside the code block so that loop only runs its code block once.

Problem:
Write a Program that counts downward using a while loop.


Solution:
1.  Create a variable named 'number' set to 100.
    and a variable named 'isCounting' set to 'false'.
2.  Create a while loop using 'isCounting' variable in the condition.
3.  Inside the code block, display the 'number' variable in the console.
4.  Run the code block one time by updating the initial value
    for 'isCounting' to 'true'.
    Then, updating it to 'false' inside the code block.
5.  The last step is using the decrement operator '--' 
    to decrease the value of 'number' by one.
