Problem:
WAP that helps the MRI Machine make scans of a patient
to create a composite image.


Task:
Using a counter variable, we'll loop three times
and display each scan number in the console.


Solution:
1.  Let's turn on our MRI machine.
    Display "Start MRI Machine" in the console.
2.  Code the for loop.
3.  Create a counter variable named 'i',
    set it to 1, and add the semicolon ';'.
4.  Create a condition that stops the loop when i is less than 4.
5.  Complete the for loop by incrementing the counter variable.
6.  Let's test our loop by printing the counter variable 'i' to the console.
