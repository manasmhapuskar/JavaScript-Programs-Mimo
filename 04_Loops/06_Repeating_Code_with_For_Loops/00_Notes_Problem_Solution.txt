Problem:
WAP that helps the MRI Machine make scans of a patient
to create a composite image.


Task:
Using a counter variable, we'll loop three times
and display each scan number in the console.


Solution:
1.  Let's turn on our MRI machine.
    Display "Start MRI Machine" in the console.
2.  Code the for loop.
3.  Create a counter variable named 'i',
    set it to 1, and add the semicolon ';'.
4.  Create a condition that stops the loop when i is less than 4.
5.  Complete the for loop by incrementing the counter variable.
6.  Let's test our loop by printing the counter variable 'i' to the console.

Problem:
Let's use our knowledge of 'for' loops to 
display a list of comments in the console.


Solution:
1.  Create a variable named 'comments' and assign it 3.
2.  Code the for loop for displaying the comments.
3.  Create the counter variable 'i' and set it to 0.
4.  Code the condition so that it runs its code block
    while 'i' is less than comments.
5.  Inside the parentheses, increment the counter variable.
6.  Last, display "Comment: " and the counter variable in the console.

Problem:
A junior developer wrote a program to display The American Flag,
but it didn't come out as planned.


Task:
Let's fix the code to display the missing stripes 
and make the while loop more readable.

JS Code ->
var i = 0;

while (i < 3) {
    i++;
    console.log("***********----------------");
}

for () {
    console.log("---------------------------");
}


Solution:
1.  Repeat the 'for' loop three times 
    by creating the counter variable 'i' set to 0,
    the condition 'i < 4', and incrementing i.
2.  Make the 'while' loop code easier to read by changing
    it from a 'while' loop to a 'for' loop.
3.  Add more stripes to the flag by changing the condition
    of the second 'for' loop.
