Problem:
Let's write a program that uses ++ and += operators
to keep track of a basketball team points.


Solution:
1.  Create a 'points' variable and assign it the value 0.
    Then, display it as "Points: " + points.
2.  When a team scores an easier shot in Basketball, the team gets two points.
    Add two points to the 'points' variable's value.
3.  For a free throw, a team only gets one.
    Use the increment operator to add one point.
4.  For a free second throw, use the increment operator to add another point.
5.  Use the += operator to add three to points
    for when the basketball team scores a three-pointer.

Problem:
Let's write a short program that changes the health of a player in a video game.
The games offers power-ups the user can pick-up to raise their health level.
Some power-ups though are traps in disguise that cause damage.


Task:
We'll store the player's health and powerup in variables,
then use conditionals to update 'health'.


Solution:
1.  Add the variable 'found' which will represent what the player finds.
    If they find a health power-up, we'll store the string "health"
2.  Create a variable named 'health' and assign it with value 56.
3.  We'll want to check what the player has come across, 
    so we'll use an 'if' statement for that.
4.  We'll want to check if the variable stored in 'found' is a health power-up.
5.  Power-ups can only increase their health by 1,
    so all we have to do is increment the 'health' variable.
6.  We'll also check if they have come across a trap in the game,
    which would decrease their health.
7.  Check if the found variable is equal to the word "damage".
8.  If they suffer damage, their health will decrement by 1.
9.  Display the 'health' variable in the console.

Problem:
Let's write a program that takes 'verb', 'adjective' and 'noun' variables
to build funny sentences using the '+=' operator.


Available:
var verb = "marry";
var adjective = "green";
var noun = "cat";

var sentence = "I wish to ";

console.log(sentence);


Solution:
1.  Start by adding 'verb' to the 'sentence' variable 
    with 'sentence += verb'.
2.  Next, add "a" to the 'sentence' variable's value.
3.  Using the += operator, add 'adjective' and a space " " 
    to the value of the 'sentence' variable.
4.  Last, use the += operator to add the 'noun' 
    to the 'sentence' variable's value.
