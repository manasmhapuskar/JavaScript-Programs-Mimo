/*
Problem:
Let's write a program that display numbers that
displays numbers that count upwards in a list. From 1., 2., 3. and so on.


Task:
We'll create a variable named 'number' outside of the loop that keeps track of numbers.
Then use it to display messages inside the loop.

var number = 1;

while (false) {
    console.log(number + ".");
    number++;

console.log("Loop broken");
