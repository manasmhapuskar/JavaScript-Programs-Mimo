Problem:
Let's write a program that display numbers that
displays numbers that count upwards in a list. From 1., 2., 3. and so on.


Task:
We'll create a variable named 'number' outside of the loop that keeps track of numbers.
Then use it to display messages inside the loop.


Solution:
1.  Create a variable named 'number' and set it to 1.
2.  Add the keyword for creating a 'while' loop.
3.  Assemble the condition set to true.
4.  Put together the code block the loop should run over and over again.
5.  Display number variable in the loop.
6.  To display '1.' in the console, add "." inside the display statement.
7.  Since, we want the numbers to increment,
    add one to the 'number' variable inside the code block using 'number++'.
8.  Infinite loops are bad. Change the condition so that the loop skips its code.
    We'll learn how to stop it in a more useful way later.
