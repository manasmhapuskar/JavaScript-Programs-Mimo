Problem:
Let's create an object for a user on Instagram
and fill it with properties.


Solution:
1.  Let's jump right into it! 
    Start creating the 'user' object with 'var' and its name.
2.  Add an equals sign, a set of curly braces, and a semicolon.
3.  An instagram user has a unique username to set them apart.
    Type in 'username' to add the first property.
4.  Now we just need to decide how we'll call the user.
    Let's call the user 'cookie_monster'.
    Set the value of 'username' to "cookie_monster".
    Start with a colon and end with the value.
5.  A few moments on Instagram and 2,000 followers already!
    Add a 'followers' property to the 'user' object and set it to 200.
6.  The user found 10 users to follow for now. Add a comma after '2000'.
    Then add a 'following' property and set it to 10.
7.  The final property the 'user' object needs is 'isOfficial'.
    Add a comma after '300'. Then add an 'isOfficial' property and a colon.
8.  Let's give the user some legitimacy for an extra follower boost.
    Set 'isOfficial' to 'true'. There's no need for a comma since it's the last property.
9.  It's time to display the user.
    Add a 'console.log()' statement that displays 'user'.
    Remember to end with a semicolon ';'.

Problem:
Time to get the music flowing!
Taylor Swift's fans are anxiously awaiting her Spotify debut.


Task:
We'll create an object for an artist on Spotify 
and fill it with properties.


Solution:
1.  Start creating the 'artist' object with 'var' and its name.
2.  Add an equals sign, a set of curly braces, and a semicolon.
3.  Let's make sure TSwift's fans can look up who they're listening to.
    Type in 'name' to add our artist's first property.
4.  Let's set the 'name' property value to "Taylor Swift".
    Start with a colon and end with the value.
5.  Wow! our artist is quite swift at producing albums!
    Add an 'albums' property to the 'artist' object and set it to '15'.
6.  Since, TSwift is new to Spotify, she doesn't have many listeners yet.
    Add a comma, then add a 'listeners' property and set it to '250'.
7.  Let's make sure nobody tries to impersonate our artist.
    Add a comma after '250', then add a 'verified' property and a colon.
8.  Set 'verified' to 'true'. Since, this is the last property, 
    we don't need a comma at the end.
9.  Let's add a 'console.log()' statement to make sure 
    we programmed our 'artist' correctly.
    Remember to end with a semicolon ';'.

Problem:
The following code keeps track of a team roster.
Let's create some objects to keep the information organized.


Available Code:
var playerName = "Leo";
var goalsScored = 4;
var gamesPlayed = 2;

var teamName = "Lions";
var numberOfPlayers = 18;
var varsity = true;


Solution:
1.  The first three variables look like they relate to the same object, a player,
    Create a new 'player' object with 'var player = {}'.
2.  Change the variable 'playerName' into a property of the 'player' object
    by adding 'playerName: "Leo"' inside the curly braces {}.
3.  Add 'goalsScored: 4' and 'gamesPlayed: 2' as properties of the 'player' object.
    Don't forget the comma between each property.
4.  Now create a second object called 'team'. Use the keyword 'var' 
    and the object name, followed by an equals sign, curly braces, and a semicolon.
5.  Turn the variables 'teamName', 'numberOfPlayers' and 'varsity'
    into properties of the object 'team'.
6.  Let's clean up our code by removing the variables
    now that they've been converted into properties.
7.  Our 'player' object is a member of the team.
    Let's add a 'member' property to the 'team' object, and give it the value 'player'.
