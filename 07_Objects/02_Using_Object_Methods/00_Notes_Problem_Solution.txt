Problem:
If you can dream it, then you can stream it!
Let's create a new video streaming service.


Available Code:
var streamingService = {};


Solution:
1.  Add a method called 'play' with the method name,
    a colon ':', and the keyword 'function'.
2.  Add a pair of parentheses and a pair of curly braces
    after the keyword 'function'.
3.  Add a 'console.log()' statement between the braces 
    to define what this method will do. Don't forget the semicolon at the end.
4.  Add the string "Now Playing" inside the parentheses of 'console.log()'.
5.  Call the object method by adding 'streamingService.play();' below the object.
6.  Give the 'play' method a parameter 'showName' by adding the parameter name
    between the parentheses after the keyword 'function'.
7.  Pass the value of 'showName' to the method by adding the show name,
    "Pick and Shorty" between the parentheses.
8.  Use 'console.log' to display the value of 'showName' inside the method.

Problem:
Feeling a little bit of Skype fatigue?
Let's fix that with a brand new video chat platform, "Skype".


Available Code:
var chatPlatform = {
    name: "Skype"
};


Solution:
1.  Begin adding a method called 'chat' with the method name,
    a colon ':' and the keyword 'function'.
2.  Add a console.log(); statement between the braces 
    to define what this method will do. 
3.  Add the string "Chatting with:" inside the parentheses of 'console.log()'.
4.  Call the object method by adding 'chatPlatform.chat();' below the object.
5.  Give the 'chat' method a parameter 'userName' by adding the parameter name
    between the parentheses after the keyword 'function'.
6.  Pass the value of 'userName' to the method by adding the name 'The Boss'
    between the parentheses.
7.  Use the display statement to display the value of 'userName' inside the method.

Problem:
Our streaming service is producing its own show.
Let's add some methods to start streaming and get those "views" up.


Available Code:
var show = {
    name: "Pick and Shorty",
    views: 10
};


Solution:
1.  Give the 'show' object a method called play.
2.  Create a var 'showName' within the 'play' method
    and set it equal to the object's 'name' property.
3.  Complete the 'console.log' statement 
    to display 'showName' after "Now Playing ".
4.  Call 'show.play()' below the object.
5.  Give the 'show' object a second method called 'addViews'.
6.  Modify the method 'addViews' so it takes a parameter 'numberOfViews'.
7.  Add code inside the 'addViews' method 
    to set 'this.views' equal to 'this.views + numberViews'
8.  After we play the show, the number of views should increase by 1.
    Add a line after 'show.play();' to call 'addViews' with parameter "1".
9.  Add a line to return 'this.views' at the end of 'addViews'.
10. Let's check to see if 'addViews' works how we expect.
    Put 'show.addViews(1)' inside a 'console.log()' statement 
    to display the value returned.
