Problem:
Let's create a trivia program
We'll use comparisons to check if the player's answers are correct.


Task:
We'll store the correct answer and the two user answers in variables
and then compare them.


Solution:
1. Display "What color is the sky?" in the console.
   It will be the first question.
2. Create a 'correctAnswer' variable and store 'blue' in it.
3. Now display "Is first answer correct?" in the console.
4. Craete a 'firstAnswer' variable and store 'red' in it.
5. Now check if 'correctAnswer' is equal to 'firstAnswer'
   and display the result in the console.
6. Create another prompt letting the user know
   if they chose the correct answer.
7. Create a 'secondAnswer' variable to keep track
   of the user's second answer.
8. Next, get 'secondAnswer' the value "blue" 
   since this is the second answer the user gives.
9. Create the print statement that will show
   if the second answer given is correct.
10. Compare 'correctAnswer' to 'secondAnswer' to show the user
    if the second answer they give is correct.

Problem:
Let's create a login process for an administrator's dashboard.
We'll store the user's account details into variables 
and then use comparisons to check if they have admin rights.


Task:
Variables account and status store the account details,
while the other variables store the comparisons.


Solution:
1. Create an 'account' variable and a 'status' variable
   and store "admin" and "inactive" in them.
2. We'll use a comparison to check if the 'account' is an "admin"
   and store the result in a 'isAdmin' variable.
3. Another variable will hold the result of checking 
   the account is in a valid state. Code the variable 'isValid'.
4. Inside 'isValid', check if 'status' does not equal "inactive".
5. Display the result of the account check stored in 'isAdmin'.
6. Display the result of the validity check stored in 'isValid'.
7. To see what happens when a user with a regular account
   tries to log in, code "regular".
