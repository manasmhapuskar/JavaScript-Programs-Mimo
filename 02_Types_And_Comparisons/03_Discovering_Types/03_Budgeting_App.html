<!-- 
Problem:
In this project, we'll write a draft of the JavaScript code
that's planned for this HTML & CSS app.

After considering regular cost, the app will use our code
to tell the user whether they should make a purchase or save instead.


Task:
Part I
We'll add fixed values for the budget and expenses.
Later, we'll learn how to connect the JavaScript to the user interface.
We'll use variables to calculate the remaining balance and
compare strings to check if savings should be prioritized.

Part II
Now that we have our values and settings, we'll make the calculations 
and comparisons that'll happen when the user presses "Compute".

Part III
Later we'll learn how to make this code much smarter.
But for now, let's change some values and see how much they affect the result.
