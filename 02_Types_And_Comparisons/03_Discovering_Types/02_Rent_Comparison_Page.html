<!-- 
Problem:
Let's code a webpage that compares the average rent in two cities,
informing the user which one is more expensive.


Task:
Part I
We'll kick off by adding some HTML elements and
linking the stylesheet.

Part II
The structure of the webpage is done. Now its time to give it some style.
We'll add CSS rules that apply to the whole webpage, then specific
ones for the comparison result.
 
Part III
Time for adding JavaScript.
We'll save the rent prices in variables, compare them and
display the results using your webpage.
