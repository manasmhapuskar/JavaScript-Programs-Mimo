Problem:
We'll write an app that makes sure that the
items in a shopping cart have good ratings.


Task:
We'll use variables to store item's stars and the ratings,
and then compare them to see where the item stands.


Solution:
1. Create a 'stars' variable and store 3, the first product's rating to it.
2. Create a second variable, 'great' and store 5 in it.
3. Create a 'good' variable that stores 4 as the number of stars.
4. Add 'ok' to store the number 3.
5. Add an empty 'console.log()' statement.
6. In the parentheses of console.log(), add the 'stars' variable.
7. Check if the number of stars of the current product
   is equal to the variable 'great'.
8. Check for equality between 'stars' and 'good'.
9. Check for equality between 'stars' and 'ok'.

Problem:
Let's help a flight booking website decide 
if a flight is fully booked.

 
Task:
We'll save the maximum number of bookings and 
the current bookings and then compare them.


Solution:
1. Create a 'maximum' variable and store 30,
   the maximum number of bookings in it.
2. Create a 'seatsBooked' variable and store 28,
   the number of already booked seats in the plane, in it.
3. Create a 'full' variable.
4. Now use the equality operator to check 
   if 'seatsBooked' is equal to maximum and 
   store the result in the full variable.
5. Add an empty display statement followed by a semicolon.
6. Show if the flight is booked out by displaying 
   "Booked out: " and the value of full.
