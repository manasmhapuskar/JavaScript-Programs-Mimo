Problem:
Let's write some code that switches an 
office air conditioner off over the weekend


Solution:
1. Start creating the first variable by coding var.
2. This code will run on a weekday.
   Create the 'isWeekday' variable and give it the value 'true'.
3. When it's a weekday, the air conditioning switch 'acOn'
   should be set to true.
4. Display "Weekday" and the value in the 'isWeekday' 
   variable in the console.
5. Now display "Air conditioning" and 
   the value in the 'acOn' variable in the console.
6. Its no longer a weekday, so change the value of isWeekday to false.
7. As its not a weekday, the air conditioner should be switched off.
   Negate the value of true.

Problem:
Let's create a smart light switch that switches the lights off
if its daytime and on if its nighttime.

 
Solution:
1. Start by creating an 'isDay' variable.
2. Let's say its daytime. Its always daytime in some part of the world.
   Set 'isDay' to 'true'.
3. Since its daytime, and we want to save energy, the lights should be off.
   Create a 'lightsOn' variable and store false in it.
4. Now use console.log() to display "Daytime?" in the console.
5. Is it daytime? is it nighttime?
   Display the value of 'isDay' variable in the console.
6. Display "Lights on?" in the console.
7. Display the value of 'lightsOn' in the console.
8. Now, lets simulate what happens during the night.
   Temporarily set 'isDay' to 'false'.
9. We also need to update 'lightsOn', of course.
   Let's put the negation operator to good use.
   Set 'lightsOn' to the opposite of 'isDay'.
