/*
Problem:
Let's use our knowledge about HTML, CSS and variables in JavaScript
to build a user profile for an online retro game.


Task:
Part I
We'll kick off the webpage by adding the HTML structure 
and some CSS to style the body. 

Part II
Let's add some more specific style rules to set apart
the Username and the Character paragraphs.

Part III
Let' create some variables for the username and character name
we'll display on the webpage.

To get you started, we added a script element that let's your
JavaScript code interact with the webpage. We'll learn more about it later.
