Problem:
We'll use comparisons to build an app that tracks
the 100-meter sprint world record. Ready, set, go!


Task:
We'll compare the variables 'record' and 'time'
to check if the record is broken.


Solution:
1.  We'll start with a variable to store the world record.
    Back in 2008, the record was 9.69 seconds.
    Create the 'record' variable and assign 9.69 to it. 
2.  To save the current contestant time,
    create the variable 'time' and assign 10.49 to it.
3.  Did they break the record? Let's find out.
    Start with an empty 'if' statement.
4.  Now, we'll use a comparison to see if the contestant's
    time was less than the record.
    Use the < sign to compare time with record.
5.  We'll want to know if the record was broken right?
    In the 'if' statement, use console.log() to display "Record broken".
6.  If the record was broken, the contestant's time will be the new record. 
    Store the value of 'time' in the 'record' variable.
7.  This time the contestant finished in 9.58 seconds.
    Did they break the record? Change the 'time' variable to 9.58.
