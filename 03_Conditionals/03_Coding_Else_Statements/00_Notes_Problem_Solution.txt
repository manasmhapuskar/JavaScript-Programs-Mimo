Problem:
Let's use 'if' and 'else' statements to create an app 
that keeps track of our financial saving goals.


Task:
We'll store our savings in 'saved', then use conditional statements
to check if we've saved enough.


Solution:
1.  Let's start with a variable to hold our balance.
    Create a new variable called 'saved' and assign it a value.
2.  Code an 'if' statement that we'll use to check 
    the amount of money we've already saved.
3.  We can now check if the saved amount is greater than or equal to our saving goal.
    Add a condition to the 'if' statement to check 
    if 'saved' is greater than or equal to our saving goal of 100.
4.  To take care of the case when we haven't saved enough,
    code an 'else' statement at the end of 'if' statement.
5.  When we reach the goal, we should get notified.
    Add a display statement to print "Saving goal reached!"
6.  Add an additional print statement to notify the user if
    they haven't reached the goal, "Continue to save!".

Problem:
Let's use an 'if/else' statement to write code for an app
that keeps track of your steps and compares them with your daily goal.


Task:
If the user's step count reaches their daily goal, we'll let them know.
Otherwise, we'll let them know how many steps they have left.


Solution:
1.  To start we'll need a variable to keep count of the user's steps.
    Create the variable 'stepsCount' and set it to 8000.
2.  To remember the user's daily goal, create the variable 'dailyGoal'
    and set it to 10000 steps.
3.  Continue by coding the 'if' statement.
    We'll use it for when the user hits the goal.
4.  In the 'if' statement's condition, check if the user's 'stepsCount'
    is greater than or equal to 'dailyGoal'.
5.  If the comparison is true, then display "Goal achieved!".
6.  For the cases when the goal isn't achieved, code an 'else' statement.
7.  Inside the else statement, create a 'left' variable and set it to
    dailyGoal minus stepsCount.
8.  Code a display statement to let user know how many steps are left.
    Join 'left' with " steps till Daily Goal".
