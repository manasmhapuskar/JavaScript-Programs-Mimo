Let's use a variable to keep track of whether a song
is already in a playlist or not for a music-streaming website.


Task:
We'll use the variable 'included' to display a message
if the song is already in the playlist.


Solution:
1.  Start with a random song like "Got me thinking" and
    save it in the variable 'song'.
2.  Create the variable 'included'.
    This keeps track of whether a song is already included or not.
3.  Let's say that the song is already on the playlist.
    Set included to 'true'.
4.  Show the playlist's new entry.
    Start by writing an empty print statement.
5.  Display "New entry: " and the variable 'song'
    to let the user know that their song is added.
6.  Next, we'll write an 'if' statement to inform the user
    about duplicate entries.
7.  Set the variable 'included' as the condition.
8.  If the song is already on the playlist,
    let the user know by displaying "Already included!".
9.  Help the user add a new song by displaying the option, "Save and continue".
