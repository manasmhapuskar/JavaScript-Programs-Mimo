Problem:
Let's use if, else if and else statements to create a smart chatbot.


Task:
The program will take user's answer to "Are you hungry?" and 
use it to give a response to the user.


Solution:
1.  Add a print statement to let our chatbot ask the user
    if they're hungry.
2.  Create an 'answer' variable with the value "No".
    Then, display it in the console.
3.  Now, let's check if the answer is No.
4.  Our chatbot should respond with "Me neither"
    if the user answers with "No".
5.  Since our bot now checks for "No",
    let's have it check for "Yes" as well as using an 'else if' statement.
6.  Add an additional print statement, "Ordering Pizza."
    when the answer is "Yes".
7.  If the answer is "Yes", the code in the else if block will be executed.
    Set the value of the variable 'answer' to "Yes" to see this in action.
8.  For other answers, tell the user that the AI isn't smart enough by
    adding an else statement displaying a message "I don't understand.".
9.  Change the answer variable to something other than "No" nor "Yes"
    to run the else statement's code block.

Problem:
Let's build a social media program that displays different messages 
based on the number of likes a post gets.


Solution:
1.  Let's start by coding the variable 'likes' for storing the number of likes.
2.  Next, create an 'if' statement that runs its code when 'likes' are equal to 0.
3.  When 'likes' equals 0, the program should display "No Likes yet...".
4.  Let's change the value of the 'likes' variable to 1,
    so we can test a different value for our program.
5.  Now that 'likes' has a different value, 
    add an empty 'else' statement to handle cases where 'likes' isn't equal to 0.
6.  Now, assemble the display statement so that the program display "1 likes".
7.  1 likes doesn't sound right. 
    Let's change that by creating an 'else if' statement for that specific case.
8.  Make sure '1 like' displays when the 'else if' statement's code block runs.

Problem:
A major greeting card company wants to provide support
for different languages on their website.


Task:
Let's help them out by updating the 'message' variable to
different messages depending on the 'language' a user requests.


Solution:
1.  To set a default message, add an else statement that sets 
    'message' to "We don't support" + language.
2.  Let's see what our program is setting 'message' to by displaying
    'message' in the console.
3.  To support Spanish, create an 'else if' statement that sets
    'message' to "Gracias" when language equals "Spanish".
4.  Now, try changing the language variable to "German" 
    to test our program with new language.
5.  Add a second 'else if' statement that sets 'message' to "Danke"
    when the language is German.

Problem:
Let's use our knowledge of conditionals to build a webpage
with buttons that switch between light, dark and ninja modes.

 
Task:
Part I
Coding the brain of the program by coding the JavaScript code.

Part II
With your JavaScript program in place,
let's move on to HTML to create the webpage for the theme picker.

Part III
Let's add CSS to give this website style.
When you're finished, we'll link the JavaScript to put the buttons into action.


Part I
Available:
div {
    border-radius: 7px;
    font-family: verdana, sans-serif;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
    text-align: center;
}

.theme {
    background-color: ghostWhite;
    height: 300px;
}

.options {
    background-color: gainsboro;
    height: 70px;
}

button {
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

Part II
We'll kick off the webpage by adding the JavaScript code that
changes label, color and image depending on the selected mode.

var mode;

var label;
var color;
var image;

 
Solution:
Part I
*.  Code the doctype, html, head, link & body elements.
1.  Create a 'div' element with the class attribute set to 'theme'
2.  Code another 'div' element with the class attribute set to "options".
3.  Inside the div element with class 'theme',
    add a paragraph displaying "Light Mode" with the class set to 'label'.
4.  Code an img element with src attribute set to "/img/light-icon.png".
5.  Inside the div element of the 'options' class,
    create a button displaying "dark". Then, set the button's class to 'Dark'.
6.  For light mode, create a button displaying "Light" and
    set its class to 'light'.
7.  Last, create the ninja mode button. Make sure its class is set to 'ninja'
    and that it displays "Ninja" on the webpage.

Part II
1.  Let's start by styling the buttons.
    Inside the rule, set the button text font-size to 17px.
2.  To set a fixed size for the buttons,
    set the height to 40px and width to 70px.
3.  Add some space around the buttons by 
    setting margin to 15px 5px 5px 0.
4.  To round the corners of images,
    create an img rule with border-radius set to 10px.
5.  Set height and width to 150px for images.
6.  Next, style the paragraph through its label class.
    Create a '.label' rule that sets font-size to 30px and margin-top to 3px.
7.  Time to add custom colors for each button.
    Start with a '.dark' rule that sets the background color to 'lightSteelBlue'.
8.  For the elements of '.light' class, set the background color to 'ghostWhite'.
9.  Last, add a rule for the 'ninja' class 
    which sets the background color to 'darkGray'.
10. JS code has been added. Check it out.

Part III
1.  Start by coding the if statement that checks 
    if the 'mode' variable is set to "light";
2.  Add an 'else if' statement that runs 
    when 'mode' is equal to "light".
3.  Finally, add an empty 'else' statement that 
    runs when 'mode' isn't "light" or "dark".
4.  When 'mode' is "dark", 'color' should be updated to "darkSlateBlue",
    'image' to "/img/dark-icon.png", and 'label' to "Dark Mode".
5.  When 'mode' is "light", 'color' should be updated to "ghostWhite",
    'image' to "/img/light-icon.png", and 'label' to "Light Mode".
6.  In the 'else' statement, set 'color' to "dimGray", 
    'image' to "/ninja-icon.png", and label to "Ninja Mode".
7.  To see your 'if' statement in action, 
    display the 'label' variable at the end of the code.
