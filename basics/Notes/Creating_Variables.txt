Problem:
Let's put your knowledge on creating variables into practice
and help a travel journaling app keep track of a traveler's location.


Task:
We'll create the variables for the country, state, and city
the traveler is in and give them string values.


Solution:
1. Let's start with the variable that keeps track of the country.
   Start creating the variable by typing 'var'.
2. Give the variable a descriptive name such as 'country'.
3. Give the country variable the string value "USA".
4. To finish creating the country variable, 
   put a semicolon at the end of the line.
5. Now let's create a variable to track the state the traveler is located in.
   Create a 'state' variable and give it the string name "Florida".
6. Next up: the city.
   Type the keyword to create a variable.
7. Give the variable a valid name i.e. 'city'.
8. Give the city variable the string value "Miami".
9. Now try creating a 'continent' variable with a string value
   "North America" on your own.

Problem:
Let's put your knowledge on 'Creating Variables' into practice
and write an app on Mario, the famous video game character.


Task:
We'll create variables for Mario's name and job and use them
to tell the world about him. Or at least the console.


Solution:
1. Let's start with the variable for Mario's name.
   Type the three-letter keyword to create a variable.
2. Call the variable as 'name'.
3. Give the 'name' variable the string value "Mario"
   and put a semicolon at the end of the line.
4. Create a 'job' variable and give it a string value.
5. Time to display Mario's name.
   Code the special instruction to display a value in the console.
6. Place the 'name' variable between the parentheses of 
   'console.log()' and put a semicolon at the end of the line.
7. Use 'console.log()' to display the value of the 'job' variable.
8. Now try changing the values of the variables 'name' and 'job'
   to other string values.
