Problem:
Let's use our knowledge of Classes with Methods
to code a Bitcoin wallet.


Task:
We'll create a 'BitcoinWallet' class 
that keeps track of the number of bitcoins inside.

We'll use a class method to handle updating
the number of bitcoins when they get added.


Solution:
1.  Start by adding the classs name and braces.
2.  Next, add the keyword required for constructing a new class,
    along with empty parentheses.
3.  When this wallet gets created, 
    it'll need a value for the initial number of bitcoins.
    Add the parameter 'bitcoin' to the constructor.
4.  Finish up the constructor by adding the braces,
    and setting the 'bitcoin' property to a value.
5.  Now it's time to add the class method
    that'll handle updating number of bitcoins.
    Create the method 'addBitcoins' and add empty parentheses.
    No need for braces yet.
6.  This method will need a parameter 'bitcoin' and braces.
7.  To update the number of bitcoins, 
    we need to update the class property 'this.bitcoins' 
    with the parameter from the method.
8.  Code the line that displays the number of bitcoins added.
9.  Create a new 'wallet' object from 'BitcoinWallet'
    and set the initial value to 0.
10. Time to add more bitcoins.
    Call the 'addBitcoins' method on the 'wallet' object and add 1 bitcoin.
    Make sure to end with a semicolon.
