Problem:
Time to practice our knowledge of Subclass Properties.
We'll work on a social media app that shares photos and videos.


Task:
The team is working on a new feature that allows looping videos.
We'll help them by making a 'Loop' subclass of a superclass called 'Video'.
Then we'll add properties for start and end times.


Solution:
1.  Start by creating a 'Video' class.
2.  Next, we'll create the constructor method.
    We'll start with the keyword 'constrcutor'.
3.  Add the necessary parentheses and braces.
4.  Add a 'length' parameter inside the constructor.
5.  Add the 'this.length' property and give it the value of the 'length' parameter.
6.  Time to create the subclass.
    Create a 'Loop' class that extends 'Video'.
7.  Add the constructor method along with its surrounding braces.
8.  Now we'll add some parameters to the constructor.
    Add 'length', 'start' and 'end' in that order.
9.  To create the 'length' property, we'll call the superclass constructor.
    Call the superclass constructor with 'super()' and pass 'length' as an argument.
10. Create the 'start' property and store the 'start' parameter to it.
11. Create the 'end' property and store the 'end' parameter to it.
12. There we go! All we need to do now is create an instance
    that has all of the parameters we need. Create an instance of 'Loop'.
13. Now display the instance and see the result.
