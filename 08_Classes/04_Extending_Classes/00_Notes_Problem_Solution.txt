Problem:
Alex is developing a life simulation game and
wants to introduce a phone communication feature.


Task:
We'll help her by introducing a virtual phone device and
a smartphone so that the characters can communicate from a distance.


Solution:
1.  Let's jump right into it!
    Assemble a class called 'Phone'.
2.  Create a 'call()' method to the 'Phone' class and
    give it a parameter named 'user'.
3.  Within the 'call()' method, 
    add a line that displays the 'user' we're calling.
4.  Next up is a 'Smartphone' class.
    Type the 'class' keyword, followed by the name and braces '{}'.
5.  Smartphones can do everything that phones do. And more.
    Make the 'Smartphone' class extend the 'Phone' class.
6.  The game characters can't make video calls from normal phones,
    but they should be able to with smartphones.
    Add the method 'videoCall(user)'.
7.  Just like before, add a line that displays the name of the user
    the character is video-calling.
8.  Brandon is a new character in our game. Let's equip him with a smartphone.
    Create a new object from the 'Smartphone' class and store it in device.
9.  Help Brandon take his new device for a test drive!
    Pick the right method call to reach "Mom" with the new device.
10. The two characters haven't met in a while, so they decide to switch to a video call.
    For that, use the 'videoCall()' method of the object that's stored in 'device'.
