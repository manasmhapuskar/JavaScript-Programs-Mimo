Problem:
Let's write some code and practice our knowledge about Class Instances.


Task:
We'll create a class template for the movies on a streaming website.
Then we'll create a few instances for movies to try it out.


Solution:
1.  Start by creating a class called 'Movie'.
2.  Add the 'constructor()' along with the 'name' parameter and braces.
3.  Add the first property, 'name'.
4.  Set 'this.name' to the 'name' parameter.
    Make sure to add a semicolon at the end.
5.  Create a 'rating' property and set its value to 0.
6.  That's it! Let's create an instance of the 'Movie' class.
    Start by creating the variable 'movie1' and adding the '=' sign.
7.  Create a new instance of the 'Movie' class.
    In the parentheses, add a string for a movie.
8.  Since, the first movie isn't that good, we'll leave the initial rating to 0 as is.
    Let's move on and add a classic.
    Create an instance of 'Movie' with the name property set to "Rocky"
    and store it in 'movie2'.
9.  Access the 'rating' property of the second movie.
10. Set the 'rating' property of 'movie2' to a well-deserved 5.
    End with a semicolon.
11. Let's follow up with a sequel.
    Create a new instance of 'Movie' and store it in 'movie3'.
12. Set the 'rating' property of 'movie3' to 4.5.
