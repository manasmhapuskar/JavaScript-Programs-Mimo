Problem:
WAP that displays a countdown and a ready-for-takeoff message
for a rocket launch site.


Solution:
1.  Code the 'function' keyword.
2.  Give the function a camel-case name, 'launchRocket'.
3.  Code parentheses after the function name.
4.  Then, add braces to mark out the lines of code 
    that belong to the function.
5.  Before takeoff, there needs to be a countdown.
    Display "3 2 1" in the console.
6.  After the countdown, the rocket is good to go.
    Display "Ready for takeoff" in the console.
7.  Here we are: at the launch pad.
    Add the function name and parentheses to run the code 
    between the braces of the function.
6.  A single rocket is far from enough to explore outer space.
    Let's launch a second rocket.
    Code 'launchRocket();' to call the function.

Problem:
WAP that uses functions to display the placeholder
for a bingo board in the console.


Solution:
1.  Start by creating an empty function named 'line'.
2.  Add a display statement along with the string
    we'll use for indicating a line.
3.  Add another empty function, this time name it 'columns'.
4.  Add the next display statement,
    along with the string we'll use to indicate columns.
5.  Call the 'line' function once.
6.  To create the columns, call the columns() function three times.
7.  Finally, call the line() function one last time
    to complete the lines and columns correctly.
