Problem:
Let's use functions to code a part of a language app.

The language app will take a verb like "run" and
display helpful information on using it in the English language.


Task:
For that, we'll create a function that takes a verb as a parameter.
Then we'll call the function with different verbs


Solution:
1.  Start by adding the keyword for creating a function.
2.  Add the function name 'display' and a 'verb' parameter between parentheses.
3.  Add braces along with 'console.log()' in between.
4.  This will let us know what verb the app will display.
    In the parentheses of console.log(), put "Verb: "
    and add the 'verb' variable to it.
5.  Display "I " and the 'verb' parameter, added together, in the console.
6.  Below, display "She ", added together with the 'verb' parameter.
7.  Let's be grammatically correct. Add an "s " after 'verb'.
8.  It's show time!
    Call the function and pass it the value "eat".
9.  Below, call the function another time and pass it the value "run".

Problem:
WAP that simulates how we could use functions 
to control parts of a music playing app.


Solution:
1.  Create an empty function called 'playlistPicker' 
    and give it a parameter named 'genre'.
2.  Next, create a variable called 'play' that 
    holds the value "Current playlist: ".
3.  Inside the function, display "play + genre" in the console.
4.  Create a new function 'shuffleSongs()' and
    give it the parameter 'setting'.
5.  Create a variable called 'shuffle' that
    holds the value "Shuffle songs: ".
6.  Inside the function, create a display statement
    that displays 'shuffle + setting' in the console.
7.  Finally, call the 'playlistPicker()' function with a genre you like.
    Then, pass a boolean value to the 'shuffleSongs()' function.

Problem:
WAP that uses a function to check 
if a file's size is within the upload limits.


Solution:
1.  Create a function called 'checkSize()' with the parameter 'fileSize'.
2.  Create a variable called 'maxSize' that 
    holds the maximum allowed gigabytes and set it to 5.
3.  Use a display statement to display "Upload Permitted"
4.  Add another display statement and inside it,
    check if 'fileSize' is less than or equal to 'maxSize'.
5.  Finally, create a new variable that holds a number value,
    then pass that variable to the 'checkSize()' function.
