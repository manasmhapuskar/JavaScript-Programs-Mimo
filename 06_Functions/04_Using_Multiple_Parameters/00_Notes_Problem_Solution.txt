Problem:
Let's use our new knowledge on functions with multiple parameters
to write code for a weather app.

By using a function, we'll take advantage of multiple parameters 
to display a summary of the temperatures for today.


Task:
We'll use a parameter called 'high' to display the highest
temperature and a parameter called 'low' to display the lowest.


Solution:
1.  Let's get started with the function that will display a summary
    of today's temperatures. Write the 'function' keyword.
2.  Let's give a descriptive name for our function.
    Since it's a weather app, we'll call it showWeather.
    Add the function name and it's parentheses.
3.  Fill the gaps with the first parameter: 'high' and the second: 'low'.
4.  Add the braces of the function.
5.  The first thing we want to do is add a nice title for users.
    Display "Today's Weather:".
6.  Next, display the highest temperature forcast.
7.  Now, use the 'low' parameter to display today's lowest temperature
    the same way we displayed the highest.
8.  Now, that the function is completed,
    let's call it by passing today's high and today's low.
