Problem:
In this project, we'll update the incoming orders of a pizza delivery
service when the page refreshes.
Other than adding new orders, 
our code should move pizzas ready for delivery for the Ready list.

 
Task:
Part I
We'll manage the order list by creating HTML elements with JavaScript
    
Part II
To move an element between the Order and Ready lists,
we delete the element from the first list and then add it to the second.


Available Code:
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/i/tonys-pizza-logo.png" alt = "">
        <div class = "incoming">
            <h3>Orders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Pizza Margherita, extra cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "ready">
            <h3>Ready</h3>
            <ul>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>


Solution:
Part I
1.  Include JavaScript in HTML code.
2.  When the page refreshers, we'll add new orders to the orders list.
    Set the ID 'orders' on the first 'ul' list, so that we can access it.
3.  In the 'script.js' file, create the variable 'orderList'.
    Then, access the list with the ID 'orders', and save it in the variable.
4.  A new pizza order came in! Create the variable 'marinara'.
    Then, create a list item and save it into the variable.
5.  Next, use '.innerHTML' to set the text of the created element to "1 Pizza Marinara".
6.  Finally, display the new pizza order by using '.appendChild()'
    to add 'marinara' to 'orderList'.
7.  Let's add another order! Create the variable 'romana'.
    Then, create a new list item and save it in the variable.
8.  Set the new list item's text to "1 Pizza Romana, extra anchovies".

Part II
1.  To access the second list, we need to set an ID.
    Set the ID 'ready' to the second 'ul' element.
2.  Create a 'readyList' variable, then access the list with the ID 'ready'
    and save it in the variable.
3.  Add the ID 'margherita' to the list item of the ul element.
4.  To move margherita to ready, create the variable 'margherita'.
    Then, access the item with the ID 'margherita' and store it in the variable.
5.  Start by using 'removeChild' to remove 'margherita' from 'orderList'.
6.  Finally, since we already have the 'margherita' variable containing the list item,
    we can use 'appendChild' to add it to the 'readyList'.
