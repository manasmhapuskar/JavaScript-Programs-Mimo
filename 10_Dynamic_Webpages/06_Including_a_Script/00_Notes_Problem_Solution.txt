Problem:
Let's use Interacting with Webpages to set up an interactive
webpage for an online store.


Task:
We'll code a basic sales page and write a function
that updates the item on sale dynamically.

 
Solution:
*.  Code the basic webpage structure.
1.  Code the script tags to include 'script.js' on the webpage.
2.  To make the h1 heading tag findable in the script,
    give it the ID "sale" and content "Sale!".
3.  In the script, we'll create a function to update the sale page.
    Start coding the 'updateSale()' function.
4.  To update the heading with new sale items,
    we'll need to access the content of the heading.
    Create a variable called 'sale' 
    and give it the content of the heading tag.
5.  Next, we'll create a variable outside of the function
    to store whatever the current sale item is.
    Code the 'saleItem' variable and store the string "Shirt".
6.  Create the variable called 'update' 
    and give it the updated value for the heading.
7.  Now its time to update the heading.
    Start by typing 'document'.
8.  Set the heading to the updated value of the variable 'update'.
9.  Finally, code 'updateSale();' to call the function
    and update the item.

Problem:
Let's use the interacting with Webpages 
to create a button that generates a user for a user.


Task:
We'll make a webpage with some user details and space for the username.
Then we'll add the function to generate the username.


Solution:
*.  Code the doctype, html, head, body and script elements.
1.  Add paragraphs for the user's name and age along with their ids.
    Then, add an empty paragraph for the username.
2.  Next, add a button with an empty 'onclick' attribute 
    and the content "Generate a username".
3.  Let's define what happens when visitors clicks on the "Generate a username" button.
    Code 'generate()' between the quotes of the 'onclick' attribute.
4.  Create a function of the 'onclick' attribute in the script.
5.  We'll combine the user's name and age to generate the username.
    Store the content of the paragraph with the ID "name" in a variable you call 'name'.
6.  Finish accessing the content of the paragraph with the ID "age".
7.  We'll need a variable to store the username. Code 'var username' to start.
8.  Add the value of the 'name' variable together with an underscore
    and the value of the 'age' variable.
9.  To update the content of the paragraph, we'll need to access it.
    Code the instruction to find the paragraph by its ID, "username".
10. Finally, code '= username' to update the content of the paragraph.
