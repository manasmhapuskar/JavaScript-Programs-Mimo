Problem:
Let's use Interacting with Webpages to set up an interactive
webpage for an online store.
 -->


<!-- 
Task:
We'll code a basic sales page and write a function
that updates the item on sale dynamically.
 -->


<!-- 
Solution:
*.  Code the basic webpage structure.
1.  Code the script tags to include 'script.js' on the webpage.
2.  To make the h1 heading tag findable in the script,
    give it the ID "sale" and content "Sale!".
3.  In the script, we'll create a function to update the sale page.
    Start coding the 'updateSale()' function.
4.  To update the heading with new sale items,
    we'll need to access the content of the heading.
    Create a variable called 'sale' 
    and give it the content of the heading tag.
5.  Next, we'll create a variable outside of the function
    to store whatever the current sale item is.
    Code the 'saleItem' variable and store the string "Shirt".
6.  Create the variable called 'update' 
    and give it the updated value for the heading.
7.  Now its time to update the heading.
    Start by typing 'document'.
8.  Set the heading to the updated value of the variable 'update'.
9.  Finally, code 'updateSale();' to call the function
    and update the item.
