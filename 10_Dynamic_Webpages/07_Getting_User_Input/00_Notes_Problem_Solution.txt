Problem:
Let's apply our knowledge of user input to build a signup page for Snapcat,
an app for sending disappearing pictures of cats.


Task:
Part I
We'll create two text fields to get the username and email of users
looking to create an account.

Part II
With the Snapcat webpage in place, let's make it interactive by accessing
and updating the values through an included script.


Solution:
HTML Code ->
*.  Start by assembling the structure of a webpage.
1.  Add an 'img' element with Snapcat's logo.
    source, "https://mimo.app/r/snapcat.png"
2.  Code a heading that displays "Create an Account".
3.  Next, assemble the code so that 
    each 'input' element has a line break below it.
4.  Set the 'type' attribute of each 'input' element to "text".
5.  Set the 'placeholder' attribute of the 'input' element to "Username".
6.  Set the 'placeholder' attribute to "Email".
7.  Give id "usernameInput" to 1st input and "emailInput" to 2nd input.
8.  Add a Sign up button to make this webpage interactive.
9.  Finally, create a paragraph with an 'id' attribute set to "message".

JavaScript Code ->
1.  Include the 'script.js' script on the webpage.
2.  Create a 'signUp()' function that's called when clicking on the Sign up button.
3.  Code 'var username' to start creating a variable 
    for the value in the Username text field.
4.  Now set the 'username' variable to the value of the Username text field.
5.  Create a 'phone' variable and give it the value that's in the Email text field.
6.  Access the content of the paragraph with the ID "message" using ".innerHTML".
7.  Finish the line of code to display the value of 'username'
    when users click on the Sign up button.
8.  Add a descriptive message after the 'username' variable
    so that users know they're signed up.
