Problem:
Sue mistakenly sent her message twice.
Let's use our knowledge of removing elements to remove the duplicate message.


Available:
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <body>
        <h3>WebChat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ron: You won't believe what happened</li>
            <li>Sue: WhatðŸ¤©?</li>
            <li>Sue: WhatðŸ¤©?</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>


Solution:
1.  'ul' is the parent of the message we want to remove,
    so start by setting the ID 'messages' to it.
2.  To remove the list item with the duplicated message,
    let's first give it the ID 'id="double"'.
3.  In the script, create the variables 'list' and 'message'.
    They'll store the parent and the child element.
4.  Save the parent by adding an equals '='
    followed by 'document.getElementById()', and the ID "messages".
5.  Save the message sent twice into message with '=',
    followed by 'document.getElementById()' and "double".
6.  To remove the message from the list, start by coding 'list'
    followed by '.removeChild();'.
7.  Finally, remove the message by adding the variable 'message'
    between the parentheses of the instruction.
