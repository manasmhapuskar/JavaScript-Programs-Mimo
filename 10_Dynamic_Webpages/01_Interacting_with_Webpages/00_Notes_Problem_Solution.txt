Problem:
Beau is a freelancer. After improving his skills with Mimo,
he wants to use JavaScript to raise the prices displayed on his website.


Task:
To get him started, we'll write the code that accesses the hourly price,
and updates it to the new one.


Solution:
1.  Before accessing the hourly price list element,
    set a descriptive ID value.
2.  To start writing JavaScript code, add the 'script' element.
3.  To access the list element, start by coding 'document'.
4.  Complete the instruction by coding '.getElementById()'.
5.  Between the parentheses, insert the ID of the first list element.
6.  Now that we've accessed the list element,
    code '.innerHTML' to access its text.
7.  Update the hourly price by coding an equals sign,
    followed by the new value, and a semicolon.
