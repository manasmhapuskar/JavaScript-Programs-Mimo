Problem:
Let's use JavaScript to create a new paragraph 
for a friend request from Luke.


Available: 
<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <body>
        <h3>
            Friend requests
        </h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Lea
            </p>
        </div>
        <script>
            
        </script>
    </body>
</html>


Solution:
1.  For a new friend request, we'll need a new variable,
    so start by creating a variable with 'var user;'
2.  Next, code an equals '=', followed by 'document.createElement()',
    to save a new element into 'user'.
3.  We want the new element to be a paragraph,
    so code "p" between the parentheses of the instruction.
4.  To set some text in the new paragraph, first access its content with 'user',
    followed by '.innerHTML' and a semicolon ';'.
5.  Finally, code '=' followed by 'Luke' 
    to set the username of the new friend request.
