<!-- 
Problem:
In this project, we'll use objects, arrays, and functions
to add items to a cart to build the online store.


Task:
Part I
Let's work on the basic structure of the website
by coding images, headings and buttons.

Part II
We've got the products down. 
Let's focus on getting the shopping cart, number of items, 
and total cost onto the webpage.

Part VII
To finish the website, we'll add a section at the bottom
that'll act as a placeholder for relevent information like contact details.
