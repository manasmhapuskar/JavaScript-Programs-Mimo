Problem:
Let's use our knowledge of interacting with elements,
to update a user's status.

 
Task:
When the page loads, 
we'll set Jolene's status to online using JavaScript Code.


Available Code:
<html lang = "en">
    <body>
        <img src = "https://mimo.app/r/jo.png" alt = "">
        <h3>Jolene</h3>
        <p>
            <em>offline</em>
        </p>
    </body>
</html>


Solution:
1.  To interact with the 'em' element, 
    start setting the ID with 'id = ""'.
2.  To easily find the element,
    choose a descriptive value for the ID attribute, "status".
3.  Code the 'script' element so we can include JavaScript code.
4.  Type 'var status;' to create the variable 
    where we'll save the 'em' element.
5.  Add an equal sign, then code the instruction needed to access the element.
6.  Inside the parentheses, use the 'em' element's ID to retrieve it.
7.  To update the status when the webpage loads, 
    start with 'status.innerHTML' and a semicolon ';'.
8.  Finally, update Jolene's status to "online".
