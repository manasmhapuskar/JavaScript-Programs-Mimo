Problem:
Let's use push() and pop() to manage 
the ingredient lists for a dessert recipe.
*/


/*
Task:
We'll store the ingredients in the array 'dessert'.
Then, use pop() to remove an ingredient and push() to add a ingredient.
*/


/*
Solution:
1.  Code a variable 'dessert' to store an empty array for the ingredients.
2.  Place "chocolate", then "banana", and finally "cherry" inside the 'dessert' array.
3.  A member of the household refuses to have cherries in their dessert.
    Code 'pop()' to remove "cherry" from the dessert array.
4.  We need another fruit, so code 'dessert.push("mango") 
    to add "mango" at the end of the array.
5.  Let's check the ingredient list!
    Code a display stmt to make the elements of the array 'dessert' show up on the console.

Problem:
Let's practice using 'push()' and 'pop()'
to help a website keep track of their posts.


Task:
Once posts are reviewed, we'll use 'pop()' to remove them 
from the 'review' array and 'push()' to add them to the 'published' array.


Solution:
1.  Create a variable named 'review' set to two posts
    waiting to be reviewed, "comment", "news".
2.  Code the variable 'post', and then a semicolon ';'.
    It will store the value of the reviewed post.
3.  "news" is reviewed. Set the post variable to 'review.pop()'.
4.  Create an empty array 'published' to store the values
    we remove from the review array.
5.  Use 'push()' to add the 'post' variable to the 'published' array.
6.  Display the 'review' array in the console.
    Then, on the next line, display the 'published' array.

Problem:
Let's use our knowledge of dynamically adding and removing array elements
to move items from a wishlist into a shopping cart.


Task:
We'll remove the last two 'wishlist' items and add them to the cart.
Then, we'll display the cart prices and their sum.


Available Code:
var book = 40;
var gardeningTools = 30;
var headphones = 50;
var mat = 25;

var wishlist = [book, gardeningTools, headphones, mat];


Solution:
1.  Create a variable named 'cart' and setting it to an empty array.
    It'll hold the wishlist items the user wants to purchase.
2.  To store the first item we'll remove from 'wishlist', create the variable 'item1'.
3.  Use an instruction to remove the last element from the 'wishlist' array,
    and save it into 'item1'.
4.  Like before, create the variable 'item2' to store the next item
    we'll remove from the 'wishlist'.
5.  Remove headphones and save it in 'item2'.
6.  Use an instruction to add both 'item1' and 'item2' to the 'cart' array.
7.  To check out the prices of the items in the cart, display "Cart prices: ".
    On the next line, display the 'cart' array.
8.  Next, create a variable named 'total' set to 'item1' plus 'item2'.
9.  Let the user know how much they'll have to pay by displaying "Total: "
    followed by the 'total' variable.
