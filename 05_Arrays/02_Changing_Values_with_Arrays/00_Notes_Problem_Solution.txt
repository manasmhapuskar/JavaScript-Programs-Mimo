Problem:
Let's practice our knowledge of arrays and indices
by helping an event set up a battle of the bands.


Task:
The event managed to store the bands in an array 
but failed to arrange who's to battle whom.

We'll give them a hand by updating 'show1' with bands at even indices 
and 'show2' with bands at odd indices.


Available Code:
var show1 = "TBA";
var show2 = "TBA";

var act = ["DC/AC", "King", "Stagnant Boulders", "The Pupae"];


Solution:
1.  Start by adding the 'show1' variable.
2.  Use the right index to get to 
    the value of the first element in the array.
3.  We'll use a string to seperate the battling bands.
    Use the + sign before and after a " vs " string.
4.  Since the first band is at index 0, which is an even index,
    we'll add another band with an even index, like the one at 'act[2]'.
5.  Next, code 'show2 = ' to start updating the variable for the second show.
6.  For the second show, we'll use the elements at odd indices.
    Code 'act[1]' to add the first element with an odd index.
7.  Again, use the + sign before and after a " vs " string.
8.  Add the remaining element with an odd index.
9.  Let's announce who's going to battle whom!
    Display 'show1' in the console.
10. For the second battle, display 'show2' in the console.

Problem:
Let's use our knowledge of arrays to manage
the stock of an online jeans shop.


Task:
The variable 'stock' stores the number of items in stocks for sizes 's', 'm', 'l'.
Using indices, we'll update the stock values for purchases and returns.


Solution:
1.  The variables 's', 'm' and 'l' store the jeans in stock for each size.
    Create a variable 'stock' set to an array holding the three variables.
2.  A customer purchases a pair of jeans in size S.
    Access the stock variable 's' from the array to start updating it.
3.  Due to the purchase, we have one item less in size S.
    Use '-=' to decrease the value of 'stock[0]' by one.
4.  Another customer returned a pair of jeans in size M.
    Like before, access the variable 'm' in the array, but increment it by one.
5.  Let's check out our current stock! Display "Stock: ".
    Then, tart displaying "s: " followed by the value of the first array element.
6.  Now, display the stock for size M.
7.  Finally, let's see how many jean pairs there are left in size L.
