Problem:
Let's put your knowledge about arrays 
and how to make decisions with them to the test.


Task:
We'll create an array to keep track of all our pokemon
and use a 'for' loop to go over the list.


Solution:
1.  We'll start by creating an empty array to store our problem.
    Create a 'pokemon' variable and assign an empty array to it.
2.  Now fill the empty array with some Pokemons.
3.  Next up: going through the pokemon collection.
    Start by creating an empty 'for' loop.
4.  Create the counter variable, 'i', and make sure the loop repeats twice.
5.  Ah yes, we forgot a pokemon: "Meowth".
    Add "Meowth" to the 'pokemon' array.
6.  Now, we need to either change the condition for the 'for' loop
    to repeat to 'i < 3' or use the length of the array.
    Repeat the loop as many times as there are elements in 'pokemon'.
7.  Now, create a variable to store the 'current' pokemon.
8.  It's time to get the pokemon out of the storage.
    Use the counter variable, 'i', as the index to access all the elements in the 'pokemon' array.
9.  Let's see which pokemon we got. Display the 'current' variable.
10. Let's let them know that we want them to fight.
    Add two more strings to make the console output more descriptive.
11. Pacing endless seas of long grass, we caught another pokemon: Eevee.
    Add "Eevee" to this list of pokemon. No need to change the loop. It works!
