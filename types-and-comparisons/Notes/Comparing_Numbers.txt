Problem:
Let's create a program that analyzes a patient's heart rate.


Task:
We'll use comparisons to check if the heart rate is too low or
too high and tell the patient if they should worry about their health.


Solution:
1. Create a 'heartRate' variable.
   It'll store the heart rate from the heart rate sensor.
2. Set the 'heartRate' variable to a number (77) so we can compare
   it to other numbers.
3. Create a 'tooLow' variable.
   We'll use it to tell us if a heart rate is too low.
4. Now check if heartRate is less than 60.
5. Create a tooHigh variable.
   We'll use it to tell us if a heart rate is too high.
6. Now check if heartRate is greater than 100.
7. We'll tell the patient if their heart rate is too low.
   Start displaying "Heart rate low: " in the console.
8. Now display the value of 'tooLow' in the console.
9. We'll also tell the patient if their heart rate is too high.
   Display "Heart rate high: " in the console.
10. Now display the value of 'tooHigh' in the console.

Problem:
Let's code part of a video game that uses 
number comparisons to decide which power-up to award.


Task:
We'll store gathered coins in a variable,
then create two other variables to save the comparisons


Solution:
1. Start by creating a 'coins' variable.
2. Create a variable 'mushroom' that we'll store a variable.
3. To get a mushroom, a player needs to have 10 or more coins.
   Check if 'coins' is greater than or equal to 10 and
   store the result of the comparison in mushroom.
4. Create another variable 'speed' for the next power-up.
5. Check if 'coins' is greater than or equal to 20 and
   store the result of the comparison in speed.
6. Time to check which power-up the player can get with their amount of coins.
   Display "Mushroom: " and the value of 'mushroom'.
7. Now create an empty console.log() instruction and
   finish with a semicolon. We'll use that for the next value.
8. Display "Speed: " and the value of 'speed'.
